Some of the documentation can be found here https://github.com/skymankarfield/fAARS-who-is-the-rooster

This is an on-the-cloud PHP engine currently being used by http://www.rocketfuelgames.ca/ to create the game engine for the game "Who is the Rooster?" (http://www.whoistherooster.com/). A licensing of the technology as a service to Rocketfuel will follow soon. Also,  http://zenfri.com/ is currently using this work to create the game engine for the game "Clandestine: Anomaly" (http://clandestineanomaly.com/), who are also interested on a license once we have a running prototype.

An NDA should be signed to see this (doc and code) since two companies have paid and signed NDAs to use this for their systems, but I don't see any problem with you seeing this. Please, don't copy.

Research and software design of this platform can be found here https://era.library.ualberta.ca/public/view/item/uuid:b8d36cef-585d-4010-8124-9a22c1384087
