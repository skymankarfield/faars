This is an on-the-cloud PHP engine currently being used by http://www.rocketfuelgames.ca/ to create the game engine for the game "Who is the Rooster?". A licensing of the technology as a service to Rocketfuel will follow soon. Also,  http://zenfri.com/ is currently using this work to create the game engine for the game "Clandestine: Anomaly" (http://clandestineanomaly.com/), who are also interested on a license once we have a running prototype.
Some of the documentation can be found here https://github.com/skymankarfield/fAARS-who-is-the-rooster
